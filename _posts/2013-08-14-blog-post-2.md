The growth of the short-term home and room rental marketplace Airbnb has been nothing short of explosive. From its inception in 2008 as a small experiment by it’s founders to make some extra money to cover rent during a design conference in San Francisco, it has grown into a global hospitality behemoth valued at [31 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/airbnb-closes-1b-round-at-31b-valuation-profitable-as-of-2h-2016-no-plans-for-ipo/.) dollars with [4 million](http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-total-worldwide-listings-2017-8) properties listed. Leveraging the power of the sharing economy, this growth has been possible without Airbnb owning a single property. 

Airbnb has emerged as a significant threat to the incumbent hotel industry, which is tightly regulated. One [study](http://people.bu.edu/zg/publications/airbnb.pdf) has shown that the introduction of Airbnb has estimated that the causal impact of the introduction of Airbnb on hotel revenue is in the range of 8-10%. In addition to this, there are concerns about the impact that Airbnb has on rental markets which are already very tight in large cities. 

These concerns, public demand as well as demand from the incumbent hotel industry has led local governments globally to try and regulate Airbnb. These regulations have taken various forms, some governments require special licensing for properties listed on Airbnb others have put in place rules that prevent apartments from being rented out for extended periods of time arguing that this puts added pressures on rental markets. 

In light of these facts, an interesting question to answer is the extent to which Airbnb is a pure peer-to-peer sharing economy market place where excess capacity is shared or if it is, as critics point out, a platform the allows businesses to operate on it. Whether the critics are right in demanding the sort of regulation that could impede Airbnb’s growth is another debate in itself, one that I will not get into. Enough talking, I will let the data speak for now. 

I use data from San Francisco that is available on insideairbnb.com, a website that regularly scrapes the Airbnb website to collect data on listings to construct visualizations to try and answer this question. The data is fairly detailed and includes the characteristics of all the listings on the platform including free text reviews of properties. I used Tableau to build the visualizations along with Python and good old Excel to wrangle the data. I built these visualizations for a [data visualization class](http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/vis17/syllabus/) that I took, the goal was to incorporate principles from data visualization to tell rich multivariate stories in an easily accessible manner.
