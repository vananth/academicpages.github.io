My name is Vignesh Ananth and Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with a background in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics. I currently work on applying a Machine Learning approach to problems related to pricing and revenue management in the airline industry at a startup called [FLYR](/http://flyrlabs.com/) in San Francisco.  

I am interested in blending ideas from Econometrics with Data Science and Machine Learning. I have been interested in the sharing economy for a while. I built a sharing economy startup called Neighbourbase in 2015. You can read about the lessons I learnt from that experience [here](/posts/2017/12/neighbourbaselessons/). My current research interests are in studying the sharing economy platforms like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb etc. in a data driven manner using causal inference techniques from Econometrics. For example, I [studied](http://www.vigneshananth.com/posts/2018/ridesharingtrafficcongestion) the effect of ride sharing platforms on traffic congestion.

I am also currently writing a paper on human interaction with Machine Learning systems, exploring questions of trust formation.

When I'm not doing any of these things, I enjoy reading books about non-fiction technology, psychology and economics - honestly anything that is non-fiction. I enjoy heavy doses of *Wired*, *New Yorker* and *The Atlantic*. I also like to consider myself an amateur runner; while I have done a couple of half-marathons, my dream is to run a full marathon or an ultra marathon one day.
